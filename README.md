## Introduction

We simple made a small application that encrypt and decrypt the plain text into cipher text and cipher text into plain text.

We used tkinter library which is GUI based library provided by python.

Basically, it was our CNS (Cryptography and Network Security) subject project and we used two different algorithm, 
<div>
  <ol>
    <b><li>Diffie Hellman Algorithm</li>
      <li>RSA Algorithm</li></b>
  </ol>
</div>

## Working
<div>
  <ol type='I'>
    <li>Application simply asked, the option like encrypt or decrypt.</li>
    <li>then asking for select key generation algorithm.</li>
    <li>then, enter the values according to algorithm needs.</li>
    <li>and, last enter plain text or cipher text whatever you choose.</li>
  </ol>
</div>
